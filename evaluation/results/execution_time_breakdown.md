## üìà Performance Pattern Analysis

### 1. Time Distribution by Query Type

#### Hospital Guidelines Search Time:
- **Broad Queries**: Average 5.85 seconds (9.6% of total time)
- **Medium Queries**: Average 4.54 seconds (9.1% of total time)
- **Specific Queries**: Average 3.96 seconds (7.1% of total time)

**Pattern**: More specific queries require less search time, indicating efficient ANNOY index performance.

#### Medical Advice Generation Time:
- **Broad Queries**: Average 53.97 seconds (89.3% of total time)
- **Medium Queries**: Average 44.68 seconds (89.5% of total time)
- **Specific Queries**: Average 51.26 seconds (91.8% of total time)

**Pattern**: Generation time dominates across all query types, with specific queries showing highest proportion.

### 2. Guidelines Retrieved vs Time Correlation

| Query Type | Avg Guidelines | Avg Search Time | Efficiency (guidelines/sec) |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Broad      | 38.5           | 5.85s          | 6.58                       |
| Medium     | 30.0           | 4.54s          | 6.61                       |
| Specific   | 20.0           | 3.96s          | 5.05                       |

**Finding**: Medium queries show optimal search efficiency, while specific queries have lower throughput but higher precision.

### 3. System Performance Bottlenecks

#### Primary Bottleneck: LLM Generation (89.7% of total time)
- **Root Cause**: Llama3-Med42-70B model inference time
- **Impact**: Dominates execution regardless of retrieval efficiency
- **Optimization Potential**: Caching, model quantization, or parallel processing

#### Secondary Factor: Hospital Guidelines Search (8.8% of total time)
- **Root Cause**: ANNOY index traversal and BGE-Large-Medical embedding computation
